Introducing "**Payback-to-ya**" npm package. Simply integrate the package into the website, and watch the magic unfold.

Once installed, the website will gradually fade away each day for a week. But don't fret – the website isn't gone; it's just playing a little disappearing act with 0 opacity. 😜

Installation

```npm i payback-to-ya```

Usage

```vanishingSpell();```

> Just execute the function and Voila!

**Future Plans:** Add a self destruct function maybe or something which can mess up the website's indentation or colors. I have way too many ideas🤐.
